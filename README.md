# Django REST-framework Study Project

This is a simple REST API built with Django REST framework. 
Main focus is how to handle various HTTP requests. 

## How To install
This project assume you've already installed pip on your environment. 

I highly encourage you to install the virutal environment so that you can create an independent environment
for this project. This can keep you out from affecting other projects due to install anything for this one. 
You can install with a following command. 
```
pip3 install virtualenv 
```

Create virtual environment on the same dir where this project root folder is located at. 
```
virtualenv [name]
```

Activate the environment
```
source [name]/bin/activate 
```

Get inside of the project folder 

```
cd [project folder]
```

Install all the dependencies 
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
